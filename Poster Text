Introduction:
- learning by demonstration
- fish what type, behavioural aspects
- landmarks and chambers
- data

Collecting data from live fish:
- python and opencv
- manually tracking for accuracy 
- data collected as a csv file so that we can pass this through ML and get it output as functional code for the mobile robot, Tango
- trajectories as well as linear and angular velocities can be calculated from this data collection
