Introduction:
- In this project we aimed to build a mobile robot using learning by demonstration
- Three-spinned sticklebacks are heavily used in research
- Associative behaviour of three-spinned sticklebacks using landmarks and chambers


Collecting data from live fish:
- Manually collected data from three-spinned sticklebacks in trials
- Using python and opencv 
- In each trial 1500 frames were analysed
- The nose and inbetween the eyes were selected, to give us orientation
- Using this data we can calculate trajectory, linear and angular velocity
- This data is then fed through a machine learning algorithm
- The data is then used in the mobile robot to model the behaviour of the fish







- For this project we manually collected data from live Three-spined sticklebacks in trials they underwent.
- In these trials the fish needed to associate lanmarks with the chamber that had food from the two chambers avaliable to choose from.
- To track the fish we used Python with opencv and collected 1500 frames of each trial selecting the mid point of the fish's nose and eyes. 
- The reason we manually tracked the fish compared to using a tracking program is to get the most accurate and concise results from the trials.
- The data collected is stored as a comma seperated value (csv) file, so that we can pass this through a machine learning (ML) algorithm to be used for our mobile robot, Tango.
- Using the data collected we can calculate the trajectories, as well as, the linear and angular velocities of the fish. 
- This tells us its direction and speed, and if it recognises the landmark as a significant indication of association to food in the chamber it is closest to.
