Tango robot hardware:
- Raspberry pi 3
- Arduino mega
- RP lidar A2 (red)
- Sabretooth dual motor controller
- 7 Sharp IR sensors
- Front bumper micro switches
- 4 Infrared fall sensors (2 front, 2 back) (IR)
- 6 Ultrasonic sensors (non functional)
- 2 12 volt motors â€“ with hall sensors
- 9 Degrees of freedom IMU
- Voltage reader (motor battery)
- Extra Bluetooth module for arduino

Machine learning:
- Multi layer perceptron regressor network
- Works with numbers - numbers in numbers out
- Attempts to predict output numbers when only given input numbers
- "learns" when given a large amount of paired input and output numbers
- 20% of data is reserved for testing after training
- This means we'll have input values, predicted outputs and known correct ouputs to compare!
- Any number of inputs can be designated, and you can even have multiple outputs!
- For example, input data can be sensor data from the fish robot and output data can be both linear and angular velocities - no need for multiple models (in theory)
- Using this we can get the robot to "learn" directly from the real fish itself!
